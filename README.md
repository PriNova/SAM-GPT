Welcome to SAM-GPT an AI-powered multi-agent system! This project aims to help users streamline processes and automate repetitive tasks using a combination of NLP and multi-agent systems. We've designed a modular and scalable architecture that allows for easy extensibility and adaptability. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or leave some feedback!

(This is a project in progress. It is not production-ready.)
